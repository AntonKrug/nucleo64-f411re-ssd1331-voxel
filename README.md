# Benchmarks

- Vertical increments does 0.3% improvement (Debug 43376ms - 43447ms)
  - It does align better to the render engine which often writes vertical lines
  - Instead of increment the WIDTH now it can increment just by +1
  - Calculation of the first ofset is simpler as well because 
    - now we do y + (x * HEIGHT), which can be simplied into a shift operation << HEIGHT_BITS because the HEIGHT is power of 2 (64), while WIDTH was not (96)
    - and because the x << HEIGHT_BITS is power of 2 then instead of addition just binary OR can be used (depending on the arch this might have the same performance)
    
- Horizontal incerement screen (Debug 43507ms - 43580ms)
